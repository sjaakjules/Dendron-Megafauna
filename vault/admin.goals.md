- Activist: not hypothesis driven but experimental research, seeking to change entrenched narratives, support future work by preserving information about threatened mega-flora.

- Inclusive: explicitly non-anthropocentric, engaging more-than-human inputs, multiple scales, and data formats.

- Participatory: supporting multiple interpretations, multiple forms of communication (?), open-source, extendable. 

- Place-based: local, etc.. .....
