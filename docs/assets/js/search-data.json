It is a cluster of knowledge, with information that flows through the cluster in particular ways. It is broken down into three major sub-clusters:\r\n\r\n- [[admin.project-structure]]\r\n- [[methods]]\r\n- [[themes]]\r\n\r\nThe research cluster is hosted on github and uses the dendron framework.\r\n\r\n### Source Environment\r\n\r\nThe source environment is a multi-format, multi-scalar, semi-structured  dataset specific to a place. It is comprised of:\r\n\r\n- [[methods.stories.component.stages.100km-biome.GIS]] data\r\n- [[methods.stories.component.event.patterns.aerial-lidar]]\r\n- [[methods.stories.component.stages.100m-forest-stand.terrestrial-lidar]] and [[methods.stories.component.stages.10m-organism.terrestrial-lidar-section]] sections\r\n- [[methods.stories.component.stages.1m-organism-part.IMBL-high-energy]] tompgrahic data\r\n- [[methods.stories.component.stages.1cm-near-surface.IMBL-low-energy]] tomopgrahic data\r\n\r\nThe source environment is also multi-format, supporting: \r\n  - images\r\n  - gifs\r\n  - links\r\n  - embedded inline\r\n\r\nThe source environment is self-hosted using the potree and 3Js frameworks.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\nActions are metadata linking the research cluster with the source environment. Actions are described using the following [[project-structure.framework.markers]]:\r\n\r\n- point cloud styling (point cloud files: colours, sizes)\r\n- point cloud interactions (javascript: specify annotations, colours, lines, callouts, buttons, animations)\r\n- point cloud location (xyz vector embedded within the URL).\r\n\r\nWhere possible, notes in the research cluster should be linked to the source environment with styling and location markers.\r\n\r\n### Stories\r\n\r\nStories are paths through the project.

When Victorian-based big tree legend Brett Mifsud commenced Tasmanian giant tree searches in the 1990s, he found that information was sparse and mainly anecdotal. We all owe so much to Brett and his years of dedicated work.\r\n>\r\n>Forest conservation campaigns spearheaded by The Wilderness Society sparked the public interest in tall trees at Beech Creek near Wayatinah in the 1980s, and subsequently a decade later in the Styx Valley. Responding to the growing public attention, Forestry Tasmania, now rebranded as Sustainable Timber Tasmania, commissioned a survey in early 2000 to measure the heights of Tasmania’s tallest trees (Kostoglou 2000). At that time, height was the main criterion for recognition of exceptional trees. Kostoglou (2000) compiled historic reports of Tasmanian trees up to 101 m tall and noted that these were considerably shorter than estimates of Victorian tree heights in the 19th century. \r\n>\r\n>The loftiest tree measured in the 2000 survey was 92 m tall — 1 m taller than the tallest existing, reliably reported Victorian tree — and therefore just sufficient for Tasmania to claim the world’s tallest hardwood at the time. The ten tallest Tasmanian trees then exceeded 85 m, and this apparently inspired Forestry Tasmania to set the threshold for giant tree protection in state forest at that height. The policy was revised to include trees of large volume in 2002, following the discovery of the 404 cubic metre El Grande, which had an impressive girth of 19 m, but at 79 m tall it would not have otherwise qualified for giant protection. Sadly El Grande was killed by Forestry Tasmania after they clearfell logged the surrounding old growth forest and fatally burnt the tree as part of a “regeneration burn”. \r\n>\r\n>Largely due to the work of a few amateurs, the number of recognised giants has considerably increased in the past 20 years, and the tallest now known tree Centurion is 100.5m tall.\r\n\r\nSource: [The Tree Projects](https://www.thetreeprojects.com)\r\n\r\n### Measurment\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-12-48-24.png)\r\nBiomass and structure type at burnt and unburnt sites\r\n\r\n**Height**\r\n\r\n>Tall trees are easy to find. State wide LiDar scans have created data sets that make it easy to see the height of trees and their emergence from the lower canopy. LiDar is a method of scanning a broad area with lasers to generate 3D spatial data that is accurate to the centimetre. \r\n>\r\n>While it is possible to still find undocumented tall trees it is increasingly difficult to do so because to the abundance of LiDar scans. We have it of good authority that all trees over 85m have been visited and ground-truthed.\r\n\r\n**Volume**\r\n\r\n>Volumetric trees are very hard to find. This is the area of most interest to the new generation of Tasmanian big tree hunters. LiDar is unreliable at best in finding these trees because they are often at or below the surrounding canopy layer.\r\n>\r\n>These trees are often much older than the tall trees and as such have lost their height because of snapped out crown structures. However, they continue to grow outwards and draw down immense amounts of atmospheric carbon.\r\n\r\nSource: [The Tree Projects](https://www.thetreeprojects.com)\r\n\r\nWe measure [[methods.data-gathering.exsitu]] using terrestrial LiDaR and [[methods.data-gathering.exsitu]] using the Synchrotron\r\n\r\n## Sites\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-12-48-04.png)\r\n\r\nLocation of sites.\r\n\r\n### (1) Tolken Track, Styx\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-13-51-04.png)\r\nSource: [The Tree Projects](https://www.thetreeprojects.com/styx-valley)\r\n\r\n\r\n>Some of the remaining giant trees of the Styx Valley were saved from logging by years of dedicated campaigning by the Wilderness Society & Greenpeace. In 2013, part of the Styx Valley was incorporated into the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area thanks to the Tasmanian Forestry Agreement, which is sometimes called the Forest Peace Deal. Successive Tasmanian governments have worked hard to dismantle this agreement.\r\n>\r\n>This site is home to one of the most successful protest actions which saved the Styx Valley from being logged and saw its rivers and ancient forests added to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area in 2013. The Global Rescue Station, a collaboration between Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society, was a series of platforms perched in a magnificent swamp gum where activists from around Australia and the planet lived aloft, sending interviews, photographs and video footage to the world. The tree was named Gandalf’s Staff, and it is the star of this walk that makes its way through a wonderland of ancient trees and luscious ferns suggestive of Tolkein’s Middle Earth. \r\n\r\nSource: [The Tree Projects](https://www.thetreeprojects.com/styx-valley)\r\n\r\n## (2) Bennets Road\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-16-05-00.png)\r\n\r\n## (3)Arve large tree\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-12-48-39.png)\r\n\r\n>In Australia’s island state of Tasmania, many of the world’s biggest flowering trees lie in ruins after this year’s bushfires. The Arve Giant, a eucalyptus regnans (“king of the eucalypts”), had attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors in recent decades, but it succumbed in January.\r\n>\r\n>Before its fall, it was a contender for the world’s biggest flowering tree by volume at 360 cubic metres, which is roughly the equivalent volume of three Boeing 737-300s. “This tree was 87 metres tall. It had a circumference of 17.2 metres. Now it is just a crumpled mess,” said Pearce.\r\n\r\nFrom [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/15/tasmanias-flowering-giants-we-will-never-see-such-trees-again)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tree Overview\r\n\r\n**Styx (Living)**\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-13-55-23.png)\r\n\r\n**Bennets (Burnt but Standing)**\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-16-06-22.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Arve Giant (Collapsed)**\r\n\r\n![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00fa056e6135acc38c0e7f3fbc191912510bec61/0_0_2400_1441/master/2400.jpg?width=465&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=5c6e98228e5a8f7dc4cd9feecc0a0119)\r\nSource: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/15/tasmanias-flowering-giants-we-will-never-see-such-trees-again)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tree images\r\n\r\n**Styx**\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/styx/styx-4.jpg)\r\n\r\nStyx - base\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/styx/styx-1.jpg)\r\n\r\nStyx - base\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-40-56.png)\r\n\r\nStyx - looking up\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-46-18.png)\r\n\r\nStyx - tree base\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-41-27.png)\r\n\r\nStyx - ferns\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-46-50.png)\r\n\r\nStyx - myrtle\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-43-18.png)\r\n\r\nStyx - base\r\n\r\n\r\nStyx - moss\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-16-07-24.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-12-48-56.png)\r\n\r\nStyx - moss\r\n\r\n**Bennets**\r\n![](/assets/images/bennets/bennets-1.jpg)\r\n\r\nBennets - burned tree\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-16-05-15.png)\r\n\r\nBennets - burned tree\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/bennets/bennets-5.jpg)\r\n\r\nBennets - burned husk with person\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-12-51-26.png)\r\n\r\nBennets - dead tree crown\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-16-09-00.png)\r\n\r\nBennets - basal bell\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-13-55-51.png)\r\n\r\nbennets - top\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-16-08-34.png)\r\n\r\nBennets - top of tree\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-12-52-24.png)\r\n\r\nBennets - Source: Yoav's art guy\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/bennets/bennets-3.jpg)\r\n\r\nBennets - burned tree\r\n\r\n**Arve**\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-42-22.png)\r\n\r\nArve - platform\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-42-54.png)\r\n\r\nArve - base\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-41-50.png)\r\n\r\nArve - hollow\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-13-53-37.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nArve - base\r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/arve/arve-2.jpg)\r\n\r\nArve - base \r\n\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/arve/arve-3.jpg)\r\n\r\nArve - base \r\n\r\n### Surrounds\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-10-20-15-44-08.png)\r\n\r\nStyx - other tree base.
